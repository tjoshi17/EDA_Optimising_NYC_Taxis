# EDA_Optimising_NYC_Taxis
## NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis ðŸš–

### Project Overview

This case study of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a analysis of a dataset on yellow taxi rides in New York City. This will enable you to understand why EDA is an important step in the process of data science and machine learning. In this case study, we will analyse demand patterns, fare trends, operational inefficiencies, and customer behaviors. The insights help to to optimize routing and dispatching, pricing strategies, and strategically positioning cabs across different zones.

### Key Analysis

- **Temporal Analysis** - Identifies peak hours and hourly, weekly and monthly demand of trips.
- **Financial Analysis** - Identifies monthly and quarterly revenue trends, tip percentage etc.
- **Operational Analysis** - Identifies slow routes, pickup/ dropoff ratios etc.
- **Fare Analysis** - Fare dependency on Trip distance, trip duration, passenger count etc.
- **Geographical Analysis** - High demand zone, Zone wise passenger counts, Top pickup and dropoff zones etc.
- **Customer Behaviour** -Identifies Tip trends and payment type for trips.

### Findings

- **Temporal Analysis** - Peak hours are evening 5 PM to 7 PM, High demand is there on weekdays and holiday months like (May-June) & (Oct - Dec).
- **Financial Analysis** - Monthly revenue varies and more in May and Oct.
- **Operational Analysis** - Slowest route is Woodside to Jackson heights. Based on slow routes traffic can be managed and diverted.
- **Fare Analysis** - Trip fare is depend on trip distance but due to traffic we canâ€™t assume that trip duration suppress the trip amount.
- **Geographical Analysis** - High demand area is JFK Airport.
- **Customer Behaviour** - Majority of people are travelling solo when using taxi service and Credit card is most popular type of payment.

### Recommendations

- Anticipating Peak Hours by dispatching more taxi units 1-2 hours before peak hours (5PM - 7PM) to anticipate rapid increasing demand.
- We have calculated slow routes based on average speed and high demands. Use this data to understand real time traffic and transport department can do route adjustments from low traffic zone.
- Deploy more taxis in high demand zones like JFK Airport, Upper East Side South, Midtown Center, Upper East Side North, Midtown East.
- Partners with Credit Card issuers and create a loyalty program to reward the customers and prolong customer lifetime value.
- Introduce higher base fares for airport trips, peak hour trips and offer discounts or promotions for off-peak hours rides to encourage more rides.
- Offer loyalty programs or incentives for frequent riders to encourage repeat business and improve customer retention.

### Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas)
- Data cleaning & Analysis
- Geospatial Analysis

### Tasks
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Analysis: Bivariate and Multivariate
4. Creating Visualisations to Support the Analysis
5. Deriving Insights and Stating Conclusions
